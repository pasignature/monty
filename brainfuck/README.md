## Brainf**k

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by
Urban MÃ¼ller, and notable for its extreme minimalism

The language consists of only eight simple commands and an
instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing-complete, it is not
intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers.
Brainfuck simply requires one to break commands into microscopic steps.
